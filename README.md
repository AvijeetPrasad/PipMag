# Getting Started

PipMag is a Python package developed to provide a streamlined and intuitive interface for browsing and querying solar observation data collected by the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST).

This project aims to assist users by offering a powerful tool to navigate through a vast amount of solar data by simplifying the process of data retrieval and organization.

In this wiki, you will find comprehensive documentation that guides you through the installation and usage of PipMag, explains the data structure it uses, outlines the conventions for naming quick-look movies, and much more. Each page in the wiki is designed to help you understand different aspects of the project, whether you're a user seeking to extract valuable insights from SST data or a contributor looking to add new features to the package.
